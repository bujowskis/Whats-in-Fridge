# Whats-in-Fridge

A mobile application providing functionalities of a smart fridge, created for Explory competition https://www.explory.pl/

The project aims at reducing the food wastage, mostly the one generated by households. It can surely be scaled up and functionalities for other sectors, e.g. restaurants can be implemented.
